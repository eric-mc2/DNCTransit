# DNC Transit Model

**Motivation**

This is a portfolio project to learn a lot about econometric panel and time series models.

**Research Question**

I pose the specious question "Do Democrats really use transit?", and try to estimate the effect of the 2024 Chicago DNC on transit ridership, including rideshares.

**Theory of Change**

We assume the DNC is an exogeneous shock that inserts tens of thousands of Democrats into Chicago. Additionally, we assume they have to get to the DNC event locations at the United Center and McCormick Place. We assume these politically active Democrats are pro-transit and will choose public transit during their stay. Leading to a measurable spike in ridership during the event, and especially in the catchement of event locations.

**Modeling Threats**

There are numerous reasons not to believe this model. It's just an exercise after all. I try to list and test them in the accompanying notebooks.
