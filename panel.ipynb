(You can choose if you want to model just random intercepts or if you want to interact the interesting regressors with the grouping column to get group-specific slopes. Some authors advise to \"keep it maximal\" in an actual controlled experiment and to use all covariates justified by the design.)

However the MLEM random effects are a deviation from the sample average, and again you don't report the group coefficients, just the variance of the coefs. Proper fixed effects models report the per group coefficient. The MLEM random effects basically model the grouping column as a normal distribution where each group's mean is sampled from this distribution. This allows you to model hundreds/thousands of groups. The \"fixed effects\" model doesn't assume the groups have a common distribution. And since it estimates an actual coefficient per group, you can't have high-cardinality groups. \n",
